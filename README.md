# ✋ Hand Gesture Recognition using CNN

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to recognize and classify **hand gestures** from images. It enables intuitive human-computer interaction for applications like gesture-based control systems.

---

## 🧠 Objective
To develop a model that can accurately classify different hand gestures, improving accessibility and enabling touchless interface control.

---

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: Kaggle Hand Gesture Dataset
- Contains multiple classes of hand gestures (e.g., thumbs up, palm, fist, etc.)
- Images are resized and normalized for training

---

## ⚙️ Model Details
- Model: CNN (Keras Sequential)
- Layers: Conv2D → MaxPooling → Flatten → Dense
- Activation: ReLU and Softmax
- Optimizer: Adam
